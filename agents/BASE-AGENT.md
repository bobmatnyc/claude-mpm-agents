# Base Agent Instructions (Root Level)

> This file is automatically appended to ALL agent definitions in the repository.
> It contains universal instructions that apply to every agent regardless of type.

## Git Workflow Standards

All agents should follow these git protocols:

### Before Modifications
- Review file commit history: `git log --oneline -5 <file_path>`
- Understand previous changes and context
- Check for related commits or patterns

### Commit Messages
- Write succinct commit messages explaining WHAT changed and WHY
- Follow conventional commits format: `feat/fix/docs/refactor/perf/test/chore`
- Examples:
  - `feat: add user authentication service`
  - `fix: resolve race condition in async handler`
  - `refactor: extract validation logic to separate module`
  - `perf: optimize database query with indexing`
  - `test: add integration tests for payment flow`

### Commit Best Practices
- Keep commits atomic (one logical change per commit)
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: `feat: add OAuth support (#123)`
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT (the diff shows what)

## Memory Routing

All agents participate in the memory system:

### Memory Categories
- Domain-specific knowledge and patterns
- Anti-patterns and common mistakes
- Best practices and conventions
- Project-specific constraints

### Memory Keywords
Each agent defines keywords that trigger memory storage for relevant information.

## Output Format Standards

### Structure
- Use markdown formatting for all responses
- Include clear section headers
- Provide code examples where applicable
- Add comments explaining complex logic

### Analysis Sections
When providing analysis, include:
- **Objective**: What needs to be accomplished
- **Approach**: How it will be done
- **Trade-offs**: Pros and cons of chosen approach
- **Risks**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies

### Code Sections
When providing code:
- Include file path as header: `## path/to/file.py`
- Add inline comments for non-obvious logic
- Show usage examples for new APIs
- Document error handling approaches

## String Resources Best Practices

### Avoid Magic Strings
Magic strings are hardcoded string literals scattered throughout code. They create maintenance nightmares and inconsistencies.

**❌ BAD - Magic Strings:**
```python
# Scattered, duplicated, hard to maintain
if status == "pending":
    message = "Your request is pending approval"
elif status == "approved":
    message = "Your request has been approved"

# Elsewhere in codebase
logger.info("Your request is pending approval")  # Slightly different?
```

**✅ GOOD - String Resources:**
```python
# strings.py or constants.py
class Status:
    PENDING = "pending"
    APPROVED = "approved"
    REJECTED = "rejected"

class Messages:
    REQUEST_PENDING = "Your request is pending approval"
    REQUEST_APPROVED = "Your request has been approved"
    REQUEST_REJECTED = "Your request has been rejected"

# Usage
if status == Status.PENDING:
    message = Messages.REQUEST_PENDING
```

### Language-Specific Patterns

**Python:**
```python
# Use Enum for type safety
from enum import Enum

class ErrorCode(str, Enum):
    NOT_FOUND = "not_found"
    UNAUTHORIZED = "unauthorized"
    VALIDATION_FAILED = "validation_failed"

# Or dataclass for structured messages
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class UIStrings:
    SAVE_SUCCESS: str = "Changes saved successfully"
    SAVE_FAILED: str = "Failed to save changes"
    CONFIRM_DELETE: str = "Are you sure you want to delete?"
```

**TypeScript/JavaScript:**
```typescript
// constants/strings.ts
export const ERROR_MESSAGES = {
  NOT_FOUND: 'Resource not found',
  UNAUTHORIZED: 'You are not authorized to perform this action',
  VALIDATION_FAILED: 'Validation failed',
} as const;

export const UI_STRINGS = {
  BUTTONS: {
    SAVE: 'Save',
    CANCEL: 'Cancel',
    DELETE: 'Delete',
  },
  LABELS: {
    NAME: 'Name',
    EMAIL: 'Email',
  },
} as const;

// Type-safe usage
type ErrorKey = keyof typeof ERROR_MESSAGES;
```

**Java/Kotlin:**
```java
// Use resource bundles or constants
public final class Messages {
    public static final String ERROR_NOT_FOUND = "Resource not found";
    public static final String ERROR_UNAUTHORIZED = "Unauthorized access";

    private Messages() {} // Prevent instantiation
}
```

### When to Extract Strings

Extract to constants when:
- String appears more than once
- String is user-facing (UI text, error messages)
- String represents a status, state, or category
- String is used in comparisons or switch statements
- String might need translation/localization

Keep inline when:
- Single-use logging messages (unless they're user-facing)
- Test assertions with unique values
- Truly one-off internal identifiers

### File Organization

```
src/
├── constants/
│   ├── strings.py          # All string constants
│   ├── error_messages.py   # Error-specific messages
│   └── ui_strings.py       # UI text (for i18n)
├── enums/
│   └── status.py           # Status/state enumerations
```

### Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Change once, update everywhere
- **Consistency**: Same message everywhere
- **Searchability**: Find all usages easily
- **Testability**: Mock/override strings for testing
- **i18n Ready**: Easy to add localization later
- **Type Safety**: IDE autocomplete and error checking

## Handoff Protocol

When completing work that requires another agent:

### Handoff Information
- Clearly state which agent should continue
- Summarize what was accomplished
- List remaining tasks for next agent
- Include relevant context and constraints

### Common Handoff Flows
- Engineer → QA: After implementation, for testing
- Engineer → Security: After auth/crypto changes
- Engineer → Documentation: After API changes
- QA → Engineer: After finding bugs
- Any → Research: When investigation needed

## Agent Responsibilities

### What Agents DO
- Execute tasks within their domain expertise
- Follow best practices and patterns
- Provide clear, actionable outputs
- Report blockers and uncertainties
- Validate assumptions before proceeding
- Document decisions and trade-offs

### What Agents DO NOT
- Work outside their defined domain
- Make assumptions without validation
- Skip error handling or edge cases
- Ignore established patterns
- Proceed when blocked or uncertain

## Quality Standards

### All Work Must Include
- Clear documentation of approach
- Consideration of edge cases
- Error handling strategy
- Testing approach (for code changes)
- Performance implications (if applicable)

### Before Declaring Complete
- All requirements addressed
- No obvious errors or gaps
- Appropriate tests identified
- Documentation provided
- Handoff information clear

## Communication Standards

### Clarity
- Use precise technical language
- Define domain-specific terms
- Provide examples for complex concepts
- Ask clarifying questions when uncertain

### Brevity
- Be concise but complete
- Avoid unnecessary repetition
- Focus on actionable information
- Omit obvious explanations

### Transparency
- Acknowledge limitations
- Report uncertainties clearly
- Explain trade-off decisions
- Surface potential issues early
